    This madual includes several functions for editing the watershed delineation results:
        Search for the drain points, where a smaller channel joins a a channel with a
            bigger strahler order ('find_drain_nodes')
        Detects and joins all small links (or watersheds, if the inputs are a polygons)
            that make-up a channel ('merge_leve1')
        Detects all channels or watersheds, if the inputs are a polygons) that contribute to a channel,
            and joins them to the channel ('merge_leve2')
        Calculates the traveling distance from a drain point, along the channel network, to the last
            drain point in the channel network ('calc_dis_to_drain')
